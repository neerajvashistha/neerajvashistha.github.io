title: Debian 8 Arrived, Mankind in Shock 
---

From last two days the mankind is ripped by the uncontrolled forces of Nature. Himalayas and people living there are the victims of this devastating destruction. The 9.3 Magnitude earthquake on Sat.25.April caused havoc in Nepal, and its neighbouring places. Death tolls have raised from 1500 to 4000 last reported today. The aftermath of this tragedy is not over yet, two more shock waves were observed afterwards. The kin and relatives of the deceased are also dead, the cremation centres are full. The plight is still not over because this is the scene of just some of the known places, there are also some places which are yet to receive the medic aid and rehabilitation facilities. The condition may become worse if mankind does not come forward with open arms and help. If we see the previous earthquake that rippled Japan, the restoration work only lasted a month and Japan was back on his foot. The restoration work should be carried out in such a way that it essentially helps and prevent more caualities.

Today, I was going through Internet and I found that Debian 8 has been released, I think it has been 2 years since Debian 7 was released. On 23rd April 2015 Ubuntu 15.04 was released, and every day a new customised Linux flavour is born, this shows the growing rate of Linux users and open community. I can predict that days will come when properitory vendors will have no reson to exist. The strong reason behind it is that the requirement of end user is increasing and the properitory vendor today may have the resources to fulfill but they cannot provide open community confidence and today's end user are becoming smarter than before. Heil FLOSS, Heil Us!!
