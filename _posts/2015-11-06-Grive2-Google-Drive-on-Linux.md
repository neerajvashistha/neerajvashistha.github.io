Gosh! I miss those days when I had free days to spent, those lazy mornings... these days I'm like superman my mind is not tried I got up this morning and after some time I don't konw how or why I decided to go for running. I'm excited to write here because I'm feeling like my hands are doing my job they are just typing and typing.

Yesterday, when I completed my Peer Assignment for Reproducible Research I got a call from Jeevan, my friend he reminded me of completing my CV and apply for Microsoft Research Intern, so I decided to do that, and look how I end up. I created a website on Github for myself because I knew that you can create a website on git but I didn't know how, so I googled and found some amazing help pages. Seriously man Google is one great dam search engine. 

That's all for the day see you in my next blog..
