title: Learing at FCC
---

When you are learning something new, and implementeing it at the same time, the experience is quite exciting and thrilling. This is what I experienced while coding for the purpose of learning at FreeCodeCamp (from here on I would refer it as FCC for the sake of simplicity). At FCC you are, as described by them, will be trained for 2080 hours obtaining certification for Front End Development Certification,  Full Stack Development Certification, etc and work on some non-profit live projects. The figure "2080" is quite big but if you get started and have a little patience it can be easily be completed in 3-4 months time each day just 3-4 hours of rigreous coding.
