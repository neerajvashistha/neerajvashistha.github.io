title: Grive2: Google Drive on Linux
---

After a long time I have finally decided to write about whatever I do, so that i can have a copy of whatever awesome things that i usually come across. 

So here it is, In Ubuntu 13.04, I had used Google Drive using grive. But since then i have changed my environment to Pantheon which is usually shipped with [elementary os], and i would say it has blown my mind off. But still it has took a heavy toll on me for installing all the packages and everything, the experience was awesome and i enjoyed it.

The last hurdle I faced was using the Google Drive through grive, after lot of searching on internet pages i finally found what i wanted. The problem with the grive was that it was not maintained and there were no updates and Google had started using  Google Drive REST API to talk to Google Drive service. So the solution which i found on one of the Git Issue [solution](https://github.com/Grive/grive/issues/311) was to use [Grive2](http://yourcmc.ru/wiki/Grive2), which is a great command line utility for sync to Gogle Drive.(Don't Dishearten yourself because its command line).
