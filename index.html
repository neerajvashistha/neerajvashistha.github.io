	<p>I get myself busy by intruding into new things just for example I created this website when I was working on <a href="https://www.edx.org/course/statistics-r-life-sciences-harvardx-ph525-1x">PH525</a> and thought of creating my CV, I ended up creating this awesome website. I'm currently pursuing my Bachelor of Computer Engineering from <em><a href="http://unipune.ac.in" title="University of Pune">University of Pune</a></em>. I'm a Tech Enthusiast and work in Data Science and Statistics, Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence Planning and Data Mining.
