	<p>I am currently working in Scandid, as Machine Learning Engineer. Previously, I was employed as a Software Engineer at Tech Mahindra where my primary work was to maintain and enhance the production environment infrastructure by writing automation and bringing insight from transactional data. At Tech Mahindra, my interest grew in Machine Learning, and I was given opportunities to showcase my skills and abilities in Machine Learning.</p>
	<p>At Scandid, I am building Conversational Agents for Shopping and Airport assistance. As I am keen to learn and understand Computer Vision, I am trying my hands on Receipt parser, though tesseract OCR exits. Since Scandid is an E-commerce site, I am working on Feature-based product recommendation by analyzing reviews for  products.</p>
	<p>I consider my self as a data science rookie, and I am passionate about Machine Learning, Data Visualisation and the impact AI can have on the world. I am into metal music and really love Iron Maiden, Behemoth to name a few. I am passionate about programming and I am fairly language agnostic. To me, coding is like writing sonnets just not in 14 lines.</p>
	<p>I'm also available for hire as a freelance progammer, intern. <a href="contact">Drop me a line</a> about your project if you're interested in working with me.</p>
